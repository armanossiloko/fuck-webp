# FUCK WEBP

There's very few things I dislike on the Internet as much as WEBP. This "tool" allows converting them to PNG or JPEG.

## Usage

1. Open [the site](https://armanossiloko.github.io/fuck-webp/) or clone the repository and open `index.html`.
2. Select an extension of your choice (PNG or JPEG; defaults to PNG).
3. Drag and drop your image into the drop zone or paste after copying the image from somewhere.
4. Profit.

## Contributing

This exists solely so that I don't have to copy WEBP images into Paint just to convert them to a PNG. Feel free to fork, make adjustments or submit a Pull Request.
